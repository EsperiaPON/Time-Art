# Notte al Museo
On the evening of the day 2018/10/20, during the event "Una notte al Time Esperia Industrial Museum", also know as "Notte al Museo", part of the festival **[Begamo Scienza](https://www.bergamoscienza.it/)**, we installed our RGB lights system at the second floor of our school again.

We used the same scripts used during the [presentation of May](../2018.05.31 - Final outcome), with only some few changes, requested by the event organizers. We had to edit the python script quickly, so there are some problems in it. The stable version of script.py remains [this](../2018.05.31 - Final outcome/script.py).

We also tried to create a simulator, to see in real time the colors of the RGB lights on the Raspberry, but we didn't had enough time to make something working. Our tests for this is in [script2.py](script2.py).

During the evening some our friends was in Citt√† Alta and made some video of the lights, visible from Viale delle Mura, even if there was a slight fog.
