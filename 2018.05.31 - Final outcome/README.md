# Final outcome
This is the final outcome of the project, for the school year 2017/2018, and was officially presented on the evening of 2018/05/31.

Maybe in the future it can be improved.

## Circuit and connections
If you want to use the LAN generated by the Raspberry (configured like explained here: [***Raspberry PI as router and server***](../001_Raspberry_PI_as_router_and_server/README.md))
* connect the Raspberry port **eth0** to the Ethernet switch
* connect the Raspberry port **eth1** to your LAN

If you want to use your existing LAN
* connect the Raspberry port **eth0** to your existing LAN

* put the Ethernet Shields on each Arduino, and connect them to the same LAN
* connect the IR LED to the PIN 3 of each Arduino

## Arduino sketch
Upload the sketch [sketch.ino](sketch.ino) on each Arduino; **remember to edit** the MAC address (it is printed on a label on the shield) and the IP address (must be different for each device) at the lines 48-49.

## Python script
Open [script.py](script.py), insert at the line 12 the Telegram bot token, generated by [@BotFather](http://t.me/botfather), and insert in the list at the line 15 the Chat IDs of the users that should be able to use the bot (to know your Chat ID, run the script and send a message to the bot, it will reply with your Chat ID).
Finally, insert the IPs of the Arduino in the list at the line 38, and run the script!
